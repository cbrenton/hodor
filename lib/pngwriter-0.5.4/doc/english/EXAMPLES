About the Examples

Run pngtest. Some PNG images will be produced. Open them with any
graphics program or even a web browser and take a look. To find out what is
going on, explore the Makefile and the pngtest.cc source. Both have many
comments. 

The pngwriter.h header file is fully commented as well,
and should you lose the PNGwriter Quick Reference, or be without internet
access to check the website, it will serve as a reference manual.

If you feel like it, take a look at the pngwriter.cc source. The makefile is fully commented as well.

The lyapunov.cc source file has an explanation of what is being generated.
Alternatively, you can get info on its usage by running lyapunov with no
arguments. If you wish to see what is going on, you can run it with

./lyapunov 999

and it will show an onscreen explanation.
