hodor is a CUDA-accelerated raytracer written by Chris Brenton.

hodor stands for Highly Optimized Device Oriented Raytracer.

At some point in the future, hodor may actually be highly optimized.

hodor, like its namesake, is a little slow. It also can only say its own name.

hodor depends on libpng++.

The truehodor branch is what hodor was originally intended to be. It is C-style
(to help with CUDA), only renders triangles, supports the Wavefront .obj file
format, and will eventually be very parallel.

The truehodor branch depends on libobj:

To build:
   make lib all

To run:
   ./hodor -w [width] -h [height] -i [input file]
